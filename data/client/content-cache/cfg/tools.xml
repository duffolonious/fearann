<!-- Meaning of interesting attributes:

- load: It usually indicates weight (in kilograms), but can also be
	increased if the material it's something like straw: the bulk
	of the object.

- durability: Not used yet, but it will have the usual meaning in
	games.

- handed: 1 or 2h, but maybe we make tools to be used alone even if
	the character holds it only with one hand.

- damage: Maybe we don't let people to use this in combat, but if so
	that's the meaning of the value.

- activity: Activities that this tool can be used for. Maybe we
	implement it in the other way around, each activity requiring
	an specific tool. Another possibility is to use it in both
	ways: activity requires tool which can do X, tool provides X
	functionality.

- restrictions: Maybe it doesn't make much sense for tools, but it's
	the counterpart of weapons of requiring str >= 20 to be able
	to wear an armour and so on.
