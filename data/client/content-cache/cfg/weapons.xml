<!-- Meaning of interesting attributes:

- load: It usually indicates weight (in kilograms), but can also be
	increased if the material it's something like straw: the bulk
	of the object.

- durability: Not used yet, but it will have the usual meaning in
	games.

- handed: 1 or 2h. This for tolls maybe it's applied only for visuals
	but you can't handle two tools at the same time, but this
	won't be applicable to weapons probably.

- weaponType: Pierce, contundent, slash.

- damage: Maybe we don't let people to use this in combat, but if so
	that's the meaning of the value.

- magicAttack: If it has magic attacks (say, firebolt when hit). Maybe
	it should be better to put as child node and not attribute, so
	we can have more than one and we can specify other things such
	as amount of damage for this attack as attribute of the child
	node (so we maintain this more structured :) ).

- magicSpell: similar to the previous one, but with charges etc. The
	same for child nodes aplies.

- abilityBonus: Magic bonus for an ability, such as str +3. Maybe we
	need this also for other things (such as bonus to armor class
	directly).

- protectionBonus: Similar to the previous one, but protection against
	fire, magic and so on.

- restrictions: In example requiring str >= 20 to be able to use some
	weapons.

- RANGED_STUFF: we need to have this into account, but nothing
	designed yet.
