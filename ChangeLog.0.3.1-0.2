	* mafm: Obsolete, not used for too long, check svn logs as needed.

	* mafm: Creating common/d20 subdir for stuff closely tighted to
	d20.

	* mafm: Simplifying TableMgr a lot, so the users of the class
	should barely care about the internals (unlike until now,
	accessing first rows and then individual rows), and saving space
	in several aspects.

	* mafm: Fixing a bug in XMLMgr, which was returning a pointer to a
	C-string local to a function, thus causing annoying crashes
	difficult to debug.

	* mafm: Improving the implementation of the class dealing with
	rolling dies: it recognizes more options and more safely, it
	initializes the seed with less predictable data, and the whole
	class and interfaces are simpler and more mantainable.

	* mafm: Improving a bit the getHostByName wrapper around the
	library function, thus making the client to not segfault when this
	function fails (it's not that uncommon connected through wireless
	networks...).

	* mafm: Cleaning up a number of files in common/, it's mostly
	cosmetic stuff and const modifiers.

	* duffolonious: a number of changes.
	1. id's for entities are now 64 bit unsigned ints (more changes necessary) - 
	combat works with this.
	2. Added basic dialog interface - discussion tree.
	3. Added action menu (basic) - for right-clicking on entities to do 
	actions (trade,fight,info,dialog).

	* duffolonious: finally got object "picking" working - where we can select
	an object (player, creature, item) by right-clicking on it with the mouse.
	And along with that, a menu pops up with the name of the object and the 
	distance to the object.  There is also an "action" button to click on - 
	currently it only picks up objects.  This is still pretty preliminary, but
	it does allow some interactivity.

	* mafm: Starting with version 0.3 in the trunk.
